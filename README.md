This is a Rest service which I using for test my Web application (EazySchoolWeb Application)1
For consuming Rest service using RestTemplate need to create a bean in my config. class. I created a beaan but I can't autowired from my ContactController. 
In my case it is a error at runtime. I delete this bean and create again but in my main class . At this time was with any issues , and work perfectly!
